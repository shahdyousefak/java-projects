Java, my first language ever learned :)

1) OOP 2019Fall Board Game: A college project - a board game which implements OOP concepts. I was one of the few in the entire batch of this university class (COMP 248) who scored a full grade in this project. It is a two player game, where each player starts with 10 energy units, where the roll of the dice lands you on a specific spot on the board. Depending on the player's position on the board, the player acquires certain energy units (positive, negative, or 0) to his total energy units. The player needs energy units to roll the dice. If the player has 0/negative energy units by his turn, he is given 3 dice rolls by default. The player who makes it to the end of the board, wins.
